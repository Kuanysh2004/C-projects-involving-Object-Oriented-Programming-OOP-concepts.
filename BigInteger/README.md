BigInteger is a class that provides the capability to work with arbitrarily long integers. It is based on the encapsulation principle 
of the C++ language, allowing for arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on numbers exceeding 
the maximum value that a regular int data type can store.
