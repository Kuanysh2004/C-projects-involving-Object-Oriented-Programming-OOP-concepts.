The "Geometry" class facilitates the manipulation of geometric shapes and is constructed upon the principles of encapsulation and inheritance. 
This class serves as a demonstration of how objects can collaborate and form a hierarchical inheritance structure. Additionally, methods have 
been implemented to check for intersections among fundamental geometric shapes.
